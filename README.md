## About

Rocket Agent is an intelligent financial AI assistant that provides personalized guidance and accountability for your financial decisions. Unlike traditional passive financial dashboards, Rocket Agent creates an active feedback loop to help you stay on track with your financial goals.

## Inspiration
Most people don't stick to budgets. Financial tools are passive dashboards with no feedback loop or accountability. It's hard to know what to change — until it's too late.

## Our Vision
Personalized guidance from day one. Ask and review things like:
- Review goals
- Plan expenses
- Ask "what if" questions

Feels like talking to a human, but faster.
